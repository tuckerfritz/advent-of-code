# Advent of Code
This repo is where I keep track of my progress on each year's Advent of Code challenges.
The repo is split up by year and then by day.

## Year 2024
This year I'm challenging myself to learn a new programming language, Go. My solutions may
not be idiomatic, but that's part of the learning process. I plan to conquer each challenge 
and get the maximum number of stars (2 per day for a total of 50).
